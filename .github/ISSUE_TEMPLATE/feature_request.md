## Description

[Example: "Currently, the `text` field doesn’t support validation for maximum and minimum lengths. However, in many cases, you need to limit user input to specific constraints..."]

<!--
  Describe the expected outcome and why you want that outcome.
  Don’t provide implementation details, save that for the 'Proposals' section.
  Assume the person reading this has zero context about your problem or use case.
-->

## Considerations

- This might be related to field validation, which is currently being tracked in issue: #1...
- The file implementing the `text` field lives at `core/text.tsx`...

<!--
  List any special considerations for this feature that might help or make the changes more difficult.
  List any other issues that might be related or affected by this feature.
-->

## Proposals

### Proposal 1

[Example: "Introduce `min` and `max` props for the field configuration object and the `<AutoField />` component..."]

<!--
  Add a high-level description of how you'd like to see the feature implemented.
  Include code examples if appropriate.
  Discuss the pros and cons of the approach where necessary.
