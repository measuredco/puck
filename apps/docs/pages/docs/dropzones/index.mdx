# Dropzones

The `<DropZone>` component allows you to create advanced layouts, like multi-columns.

- **zone** (`string`): Identifier for the zone of your component, unique to the parent component
- **style** (`CSSProperties`): Custom inline styles

## The Rules of DropZones

The current DropZone implementation has certain rules and limitations:

1. You can drag from the component list on the LHS into any DropZone
2. You can drag components between DropZones, so long as those DropZones share a parent (also known as _area_)
3. You can't drag between DropZones that don't share a parent (or _area_)
4. Your mouse must be directly over a DropZone for a collision to be detected
