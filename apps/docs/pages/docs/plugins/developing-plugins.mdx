# Developing a plugin

The plugin API follows a React paradigm. Each plugin passed to the Puck editor can provide three functions:

- `renderRoot` (`Component`): Render the root node of the preview content
- `renderRootFields` (`Component`): Render the root fields
- `renderFields` (`Component`): Render the fields for the currently selected component

Each render function receives the `children` prop, which you must render, and the `data` prop, which can be used to read the data model.

## Example

Here's a basic plugin that renders a "My plugin" heading in the root field area:

```jsx
const myPlugin = {
  renderRootFields: (props) => (
    <div>
      {props.children}

      <h2>My plugin</h2>
    </div>
  ),
};
```
