# Plugin API

> **⚠️ The plugin API is highly experimental and is likely to experience breaking changes.**

The plugin API enables developers to distribute plugins to customize the Puck interface.

## Official plugins

- [`heading-analyzer`](https://github.com/measuredco/puck/tree/main/packages/plugin-heading-analyzer): Analyze the heading outline of your page and be warned when you're not respecting WCAG 2 accessibility standards.

Please see the [awesome-puck repo](https://github.com/measuredco/awesome-puck) for a full list of community plugins.

## Developing a plugin

Plugins implement the same [`overrides`](/docs/api-reference/overrides) API used to build [custom interfaces](custom-interfaces#ui-overrides):

```tsx showLineNumbers copy {3-9, 15}
import { Puck } from "@measured/puck";

const MyPlugin = {
  overrides: {
    componentItem: ({ name }) => (
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: "hotpink" }}>{name}</div>
    ),
  },
};

export function Editor() {
  return (
    <Puck
      // ...
      plugins={[MyPlugin]}
    />
  );
}
```

## Plugin currying

Plugins are rendered in the order they are defined. Unless otherwise specified, all overrides are _curried_, meaning that the return node of one plugin will be passed as `children` to the next plugin.

This may result in some incompatible plugin combinations. To improve your chance of building a widely compatible plugin, consider:

1. Implementing as few override methods as you need
2. Always rendering `children` if possible

## Custom fields

Plugins enable full UI overhauls. If you're creating a field for a specific use-case, you might be better off distributing a [custom field](custom-fields).
