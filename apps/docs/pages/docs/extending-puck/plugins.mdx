# Plugin API

Puck provides an experimental plugin API to create sharable extensions to Puck.

## Official plugins

- [`heading-analyzer`](https://github.com/measuredco/puck/tree/main/packages/plugin-heading-analyzer): Analyze the heading outline of your page and be warned when you're not respecting WCAG 2 accessibility standards.

## Developing a plugin

Please see the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/plugins) for documentation.
