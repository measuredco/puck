# Data Migration

Puck follows semantic versioning. Major releases may introduce breaking changes for your Data payload.

Puck provides the `migrate` helper method to help migrate legacy data payloads to the latest data model, transforming any deprecated properties to their latest counterparts as described by the [Data API reference](/docs/api-reference/data).

```tsx
import { migrate } from "@measured/puck";

migrate(legacyData);
```
