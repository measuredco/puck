# Introduction

Welcome to the Puck documentation!

## What is Puck?

Puck is a modular, open-source visual editor for React.js. You can use Puck to build custom drag-and-drop experiences with your own application and React components.

Because Puck is just a React component, it plays well with all React.js environments, including Next.js. You own your data and there's no vendor lock-in.

Puck is also licensed under MIT, making it suitable for both internal systems and commercial applications.
